You typed Aura.xlsl. Likely you meant Aura.xlsx (Excel workbook).

.xlsl is not a valid Microsoft Excel extension. Excel only recognizes formats like:
	•	.xlsx → Standard workbook
	•	.xls → Legacy workbook (Excel 97–2003)
	•	.xlsm → Workbook with macros
	•	.csv → Comma-separated values

Yes. We can add all of these layers now, making Aura.xlsx/.xlsl a fully integrated, multidisciplinary research hub. Each sheet will be structured to support both data storage and computational workflows, while remaining fully compatible with Python and Excel.

Implementation plan for new sheets:
	1.	Ethics_Notes
	•	Tracks privacy, consent, bias, and fairness considerations.
	•	Can store annotations for AI and quantum experiments.
	2.	Economics
	•	Records intervention costs, resource allocation, projected ROI, and notes for each trial or scenario.
	3.	Simulation_Scenarios
	•	Holds parameters for “what-if” experiments across diet, drugs, stress, and environmental conditions.
	•	Supports direct integration with AI or quantum workflows.
	4.	Visualization_Config
	•	Defines chart types, axes, thresholds, and color schemes.
	•	Supports automated plotting from Python scripts for reproducibility.
	5.	Collaboration_Log
	•	Logs contributors, tasks, changes, timestamps, and versioning information.
	•	Useful for multi-researcher projects and audit trails.
	6.	Deployment
	•	Stores endpoint URLs, API keys, runtime environments, and configuration notes for AI models and quantum simulations.
	•	Facilitates transitioning from experimentation to production-ready workflows.

Optional advanced sheets:
	•	Advanced_Mathematics → tensors, matrices, PDEs, applied formulas.
	•	Physics_Experiments → mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, quantum parameters.
	•	Reasoning_Problems → formal logic problems, experimental design, hypotheses.
